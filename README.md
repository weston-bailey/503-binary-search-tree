# Binary Search Tree ðŸŒ´

We are going to be implementing a Binary Tree together! ðŸŽ‰

Since Trees are a data structure that relies on nodes, I like to think of a Binary Tree as a pre-sorted type of linked list. There is a little algorithmic logic to how a BST stores the data.

To get started head over to BinaryTree.py and check out the classes there. There are method stubs that we are going to fill out together!

#### Data structures that rely on nodes

...and a good order to study them in.

1. Linked lists -- introduction to node based data structures
1. Binary Search Trees -- more complex algorithm for sorting nodes based on their value
1. N-ary Trees -- Trees that can have up to `n` children
1. Tries -- N-ary tree that represents relationships between nodes (frequently used for storing words/auto completion lookup)
1. Graphs -- any node can be linked to any other node in this data structure, are often expressed in either `adjacency lists` or `adjacency matrices` 

## Challenges: 

```python
    def size():
        '''
            size() -> int:\n 
            Calculate the number of nodes in the tree, starting from the root
        '''
        pass

    def height():
        '''
            height() -> int:\n 
            Calculate the maximum depth of nodes starting at the root
        '''
        pass

    def get_max():
        '''
            get_max() -> int:\n 
            perform depth first search
            Calculate the maximum value held in the tree
        '''
        pass

    def get_min():
        '''
            get_min() -> int:\n 
            perform depth first search
            Calculate the minimum value held in the tree
        '''
        pass
```
